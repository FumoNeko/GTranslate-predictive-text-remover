Tampermonkey script for removing predictive text

Tampermonkey is a Browser Addon for Firefox and Google Chrome that modifies active page content on any website you are viewing. It allows for custom user created code from it's community to modify any webpage to their liking as long as they have a script for that webpage. You can do things like remove ads, modify how the page looks, replace links, or change how something works.

This script removes the predictive text (The suggested words) while you are typing in a different language by removing a certain div on the Page's HTML code.
